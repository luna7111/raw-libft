# Raw Libft

This is my Libft as I submitted it. If you are looking for the updated library I use in my projects (with new functions and optimized old functions), check [this other repo](https://github.com/luna7111/libft).

This project passed with 125/100, but keep in mind copying code for your Libft is a bad idea since you will be asked how the functions work and you need to be able to deffend yourself during corrections, and you can be punished (or even expelled) if you cheat on your projects.

My login is ldel-val, if you need any help with your project, ask for it ðŸ˜Š.
